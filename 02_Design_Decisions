# Design Decisions – BestWayGrow

## 1. Product Category Model
- The system uses **Product Categories**, not packs.
- Five fixed categories are defined:
  - 500
  - 1500
  - 3000
  - 5000
  - 10000
- Category 1 (500) is marked as **Free Registration**.

## 2. Upgradation Logic
- Users can upgrade only from a **lower category to a higher category**.
- Downgrade is not allowed.
- Upgradation rules are system-controlled and documented.

## 3. Repurchase Decision
- Repurchase is allowed.
- **No direct commission** is given on repurchase.
- Repurchase is tracked only for system records.

## 4. Fair Distribution Principle
- System follows **equal opportunity logic**.
- No manual advantage is given to any user.
- Structure decisions are transparent and documented.

## 5. Change Control
- Any future change must be:
  - Discussed
  - Documented
  - Versioned in this repository
