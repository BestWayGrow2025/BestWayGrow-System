# Core Design Decisions

## 1. System Philosophy
- The platform follows a Business Volume (BV) driven model
- All earnings, qualifications, and royalty calculations are based on BV
- Product price is independent from income calculations

## 2. Product Strategy
- The company offers digital products as primary products
- Physical products may be introduced as add-on products
- All products are assigned BV as defined by the company
- Product selection is optional and choice-based

## 3. Activation & Participation
- Registration is free for all users
- System activation is required to participate in compensation plans
- Activation and participation are based on BV completion
- No product purchase guarantees income

## 4. Income Principle
- Income is generated through real product usage and sales activity
- There is no assured or fixed return
- Earnings depend on individual effort and network performance

## 5. Future Expansion
- The system allows introduction of new products and services
- Future participation options, if any, will be BV-based
- No change in product price affects existing BV logic
