# Design Decisions – BestWayGrow
## 1. Product Category Model
- The system uses **Product Categories**, not packs.
- Five fixed product categories are defined:
  - 500
  - 1500
  - 3000
  - 5000
  - 10000
- **User registration is free.**
- Category 1 (500) is the **first purchasable product category**.

## 2. Upgradation Logic
- Users can upgrade from **any lower category to any higher category**.
- **Each category can be upgraded only one time.**
- Purchasing the **same category again** is treated as **repurchase**.
- Purchasing **any lower category after a higher category is already active** is treated as **repurchase**.
- There are **no conditional restrictions** on upgradation.
- Moving from a higher category to a lower category is **not allowed as upgradation**.

## 3. Repurchase Decision
- Repurchase is allowed.
- **No direct commission** is given on repurchase.
- Repurchase is tracked only for system records.

## 4. Fair Distribution Principle
- System follows **equal opportunity logic**.
- No manual advantage is given to any user.
- Structure decisions are transparent and documented.

## 5. Change Control
- Any future change must be:
  - Discussed
  - Documented
  - Versioned in this repository
