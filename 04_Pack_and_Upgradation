# Product & BV Structure

## 1. Product
- Company offers digital products for system participation
- All digital products carry a fixed BV of 2100
- Product selection is optional and choice-based
- Physical products may be added as optional add-ons in the future

## 2. Activation
- System activation is required to participate in compensation plans
- Activation requires completion of BV 2100
- BV can be accumulated through purchase of digital or optional physical products
- Activation is independent of product price

## 3. Repurchase & Upgrades
- Digital or physical products may be repurchased for personal use or continued participation
- Repurchase contributes to BV accumulation
- Future system upgrades or participation options will be BV-based
- No upgrade is linked to product price

## 4. System Principle
- All participation, activation, and income calculations follow BV-based logic
- Product price does not affect BV or income
- Earnings depend on personal effort and system activity
