## 1. System Overview
- Website built using HTML (BestWayGrow2025 repo)
- Documentation and system plan in BestWayGrow-System repo
- Modular design for easy upgrades and maintenance
- All technical modules follow BV-based activation and qualification rules defined in Design Decisions

## 2. Folder Structure
- Phase-1 documentation folders 01–09
- Key files: users_and_roles.md, pack_structure.md, design_decisions.md, etc.
- Purpose: documentation and rule definition only
- No executable business logic included in documentation folders

## 3. Technology Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend  | HTML, CSS  |
| Backend   | Node.js / PHP (to be finalized) |
| Database  | MySQL / PostgreSQL (to be finalized) |
| Hosting   | Cloud-based (AWS / equivalent) |

## 4. Notes
- Detailed architecture diagrams can be added here
- Update as system evolves
- All modules follow BV-first logic for activation, repurchase, and income calculations
